# House Pricing ML

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices based on various features. The project is inspired by the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the sale prices of residential homes based on their characteristics. By leveraging advanced regression techniques, this project aims to deliver reliable price predictions that can assist real estate professionals.

## Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Checked dataset structure and summary statistics using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`.
   - Analyzed missing values, identifying features with significant null entries like `LotFrontage` and `Alley`.
   - Examined unique values for categorical features (e.g., `MSZoning`, `Street`) to plan for encoding.
   - Visualized key insights:
     - Heatmap to explore correlations between numerical features and `SalePrice`.
     - Distribution analysis of `SalePrice`, revealing positive skewness.
     - Scatterplots and boxplots to analyze relationships between features and `SalePrice`.
     - Bar plot of missing values to prioritize preprocessing tasks.

2. **Handling Missing and Categorical Data**:
   - Missing values in features like `PoolQC`, `Alley`, and `GarageType` were replaced with meaningful defaults (e.g., `"NoPool"`, `"NoAlley"`, `"NoGarage"`) based on feature context.
   - Numerical features with missing values, such as `LotFrontage`, were imputed using grouped medians (e.g., median by `Neighborhood`).
   - Categorical features were transformed to include placeholders like `"NoFeature"` for consistency.

3. **Feature Engineering** (Planned):
   - Apply transformations like log-scaling for skewed features.
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical variables for better model compatibility.

4. **Modeling** (Planned):
   - Train and evaluate multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
   - Use hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve performance.

5. **Evaluation** (Planned):
   - Assess model performance using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).
   - Compare models to identify the best-performing one.

6. **Results** (Planned):
   - Generate predictions for the test set and summarize findings.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes:
- **Training Data**: 79 features describing various attributes of houses, with the target variable, `SalePrice`.
- **Test Data**: Contains the same features but excludes the target variable for evaluation.
- **Feature Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of the features can be found in the [Kaggle data description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

### Insights So Far:
- Features like `LotFrontage` and `Alley` have significant missing values, requiring imputation or removal.
- Categorical features such as `MSZoning` and `Neighborhood` show meaningful groupings for `SalePrice`.
- Numerical features like `GrLivArea` and `OverallQual` exhibit strong positive correlations with `SalePrice`.
- The target variable `SalePrice` is positively skewed, suggesting potential log-transformation during preprocessing.

## Evaluation Metric

The evaluation metric used is **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)**, designed to equally penalize errors for expensive and inexpensive houses:

$$
RMSLE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\log(\text{Prediction}_i + 1) - \log(\text{Actual}_i + 1))^2}
$$

This metric ensures proportional fairness across price ranges, and minimizing it is the primary objective of this project. For further details, refer to the [Kaggle evaluation section](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/evaluation).

## Visualizations So Far

- **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlights relationships between numerical features and `SalePrice`.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Reveals the skewness of `SalePrice` and potential outliers.
- **Feature Relationships**: Scatterplots and boxplots demonstrate how numerical and categorical features relate to `SalePrice`.
- **Missing Value Analysis**: Bar plot prioritizes features with significant missing data.
